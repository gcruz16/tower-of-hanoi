# Tower of Hanoi

## Description
Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consist of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod.
The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

Objective is to move the entire stack to another rod .

## Rules
* Only one disk can be moved at a time.
* Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
* No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
* If you cannot select a disk it means you canÂ´t legally move it anywhere.

## Example

The initial state (a), an intermediate state (b), and the final state (c) for a set of 6 disks are showing in the following figures:
